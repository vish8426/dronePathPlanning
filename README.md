Drone Motion Planning Design &amp; Modelling Project

## About
The following project involves the details surrounding a plan for a time-optimal path utilized by an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). The path of the UAV is assumed to travel point-to-point within a complex wind field. This is represented by a vector field at points within the 2D space denoted in figure 1. Each point represents a 2D vector representing the winds which are assumed to be known within the system design. Furthermore, this report includes an analysis of the system and its planning with each path.
